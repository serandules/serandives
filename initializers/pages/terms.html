    criminal penalties.</p>
<h2><b>10. Paid postings</b></h2>
<p>We may charge a fee to post Content in some areas of the Services. The fee is an access fee permitting Content to be
    posted in a designated area. Each party posting Content to the Service is responsible for said Content and
    compliance with the Terms. All fees paid will be non-refundable in the event that Content is removed from the
    Service for violating the Terms.</p>
<h2><b>11. Limitations on service</b></h2>
<p>You acknowledge that SERANDs may establish limits concerning use of the Service, including the maximum number of days
    that Content will be retained by the Service, the maximum number and size of postings, email messages, or other

    non-commercial public archives that use such tools to gather information for the sole purpose of displaying

</p>
<h2><b>15. Disclaimer of warranties</b></h2>
<p>You agree that the use of the SERANDs site and the Service is entirely at your own risk. The SERANDs site and the
    Service are provided on an "as is" or "as available" basis, without any warranties of any kind. All express and
    implied warranties, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
    purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights are expressly disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted by law.
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, SERANDs disclaims any warranties for the security, reliability, timeliness,
    accuracy, and performance of the SERANDs site and the Service. To the fullest extent permitted by law, SERANDs
    disclaims any warranties for other services or goods received through or advertised on the SERANDs site or the sites
    or the Service, or accessed through any links on the SERANDs site. To the fullest extent permitted by law, SERANDs
    disclaims any warranties for viruses or other harmful components in connection with the SERANDs site or the Service.
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties. In such jurisdictions, some of the foregoing
    disclaimers may not apply to you insofar as they relate to implied warranties.</p>
<h2><b>16. Limitations of liability</b></h2>
<p>Under no circumstances shall SERANDs be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary
    damages (even if SERANDs has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from any aspect of your use
    of the SERANDs site or the Service, whether the damages arise from the use or misuse of the SERANDs site or the
    Service, from the inability to use the SERANDs site or the Service, or the interruption, suspension, modification,
    alteration, or termination of the SERANDs site or the Service. Such limitation shall also apply with respect to
    damages incurred by reason of other services or products received through or advertised in connection with the
    SERANDs site or the service or any links on the SERANDs site, as well as by reason of any information or advice
    received through or advertised in connection with the SERANDs site or the Service or any links on the SERANDs site.
    These limitations shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law. In some jurisdictions, limitations of
    liability are not permitted. In such jurisdictions, some of the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</p>
<h2><b>17. Indemnity</b></h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold SERANDs, its officers, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, directors,
    officers, agents, service providers, suppliers and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including
    reasonable attorney fees and court costs, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post
    or make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your violation of the Terms, your breach of any of
    the representations and warranties herein, or your violation of any rights of another.</p>
<h2><b>18. General information</b></h2>
<p>The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and SERANDs and govern your use of the Service, superseding any
    prior agreements between you and SERANDs. The Terms and the relationship between you and SERANDs shall be governed
    by the laws of Sri Lanka without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and SERANDs agree to submit to the
    personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Sri Lanka. The failure of SERANDs to
    exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
    any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless
    agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and
    the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law
    to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms must be
    filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
<h2><b>19. Violation of terms and liquidated damages</b></h2>
<p>Please report any violations of the Terms by flagging the posting(s) for review, or by contacting us.</p>
<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to
    subsequent or similar breaches.
    <br>
</p>
<p>You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult to quantify, if it becomes necessary for SERANDs
    to pursue legal action to enforce these Terms, you will be liable to pay SERANDs the following amounts as liquidated
    damages, which you accept as reasonable estimates of SERANDs' damages for the specified breaches of these Terms
    <br>
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>If you post a listing and/or a message that (1) impersonates any person or entity (2) falsely states or
        otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity or (3) that includes personal or identifying
        information about another person without that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay SERANDs one hundred
        thousand rupees (LKR 100,000) for each such message. This provision does not apply to Content that constitutes
        lawful non-deceptive parody of public figures.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>If SERANDs establishes limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or terminates your access
        to or use of the Service, you agree to pay SERANDs ten thousand rupees (LKR 10,000) for each listing and/or
        message posted in excess of such limits or for each day on which you access SERANDs in excess of such limits,

        <br>
    </li>
    <li>If you send unsolicited email advertisements to SERANDs email addresses or through SERANDs computer systems, you

        <br>
    </li>
    <li>If you post Content in violation of the Terms, other than as described above, you agree to pay SERANDs ten
        thousand rupees (LKR 10,000) for each Item of Content posted. In its sole discretion, SERANDs may elect to issue
        a warning before assessing damages.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>If you are a Posting Agent that uses the Service in violation of the Terms, in addition to any liquidated
        damages under clause (d), you agree to pay SERANDs ten thousand rupees (LKR 10,000) for each and every Item you
        post in violation of the Terms. A Posting Agent will also be deemed an agent of the party engaging the Posting
        Agent to access the Service (the "Principal"), and the Principal (by engaging the Posting Agent in violation of
        the Terms) agrees to pay SERANDs an additional ten thousand rupees (LKR 10,000) for each Item posted by the
        Posting Agent on behalf of the Principal in violation of the Terms.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>If you aggregate, display, copy, duplicate, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except
        for your own Content) in violation of these Terms without SERANDs's express written permission, you agree to pay
        SERANDs five hundred thousand rupees (LKR 500,000) for each day on which you engage in such conduct.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>If you collect personal data about other users for commercial or unlawful purposes, and/or if you make
        unsolicited contact with anyone for any commercial purpose in violation of these Terms without SERANDs's express
        written permission, you agree to pay SERANDs five hundred thousand rupees (LKR 500,000) for each day on which
        you engage in such conduct.
        <br>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, you agree to pay SERANDs's actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, SERANDs retains the right to seek the remedy of specific
    performance of any term contained in these Terms, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any
    such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any combination thereof.
