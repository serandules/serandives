<div>Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use the personal information you
    provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using serandives.com or its affiliates (“SERANDs”)
    and our products or services (the “Services”).
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>What information do we collect</b></h3>
<div>When you visit SERANDs, you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose
    to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and website use information collected on an aggregate basis as
    you and others browse SERANDs.
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>Personal information you choose to provide</b><br></h3>
<div>You can generally visit SERANDs without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself, and you
    do not need an account to browse listings.<br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you choose to create an account and/or use our Services, we may collect personally identifiable information that
    you submit such as your name, contact data (address, email address, phone number) and other similar information.
    Likewise, we may also collect additional personally identifiable information that you voluntarily include in your
    listings or transmit with your communications to us.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The information that you provide when you post a listing is displayed in public areas and available to all
    visitors. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, so please exercise caution.
    We also provide you with the option to submit pictures and/or a description of your item or service. When you post
    your listing on SERANDs, the description and pictures are displayed on SERANDs and accessible to visitors on
    SERANDs.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you provide personal information to a buyer or seller, we have no control over how that information might be
    used by that individual.
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>Web site use information</b></h3>
<div>Similar to other commercial websites, SERANDs utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation
    below, "What are cookies?") and web server logs to collect information about how SERANDs is used. Information
    gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at
    SERANDs, and the websites visited just before and just after SERANDs. We, our advertisers and ad serving companies
    may also use small technology or pieces of code to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and
    how users responded to them.
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>How do we use the information that you provide to us</b>
</h3>
<div>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering and expanding SERANDs and the Services.
    More specifically, we use personal information to provide the Services; provide customer service; troubleshoot
    problems; encourage safe buying and selling and enforce our policies; customize your experience, measure interest in
    our services, improve our services; and do other things for you as described when we collect the information.
    Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to SERANDs and/or the
    Services.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. We may disclose
    personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or
    other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. We may also share
    personal information with service providers who help with our business operations, and third-party websites and
    publishers so the listings (or the content of the listings) published on SERANDs can also be published on a broader
    array of websites.
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>What are cookies</b></h3>
<div>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a
    website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive
    specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookies to your browser if your browser's
    preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has
    already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers)
    use cookies that originate from their sites. We have no access or control over these cookies.
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>How do we use the information we collect from cookies</b>
</h3>
<div>As you use SERANDs, the websites use their cookies to differentiate you from other users. Cookies, in conjunction
    with our web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting SERANDs and which
    parts of SERANDs are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve SERANDs and better
    serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally
    store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>Sharing information with third parties</b></h3>
<div>SERANDs contains links to other websites on the Internet. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the
    information collection, use and privacy practices of such other websites and third parties. We encourage you to be
    aware when you leave SERANDs and to read the privacy statements of each and every other website that may collect
    your personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by us from
    SERANDs.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We use third party vendors, including Google to serve advertisements when you visit SERANDs. These vendors may use
    information about your visits to SERANDs in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of
    interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to SERANDs, these vendors may place or recognize a unique
    cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags. Our privacy policy does not cover any use of
    information that a third-party ad-serving company may collect from you. These companies have their own policies as
    to record keeping and data retention. If you would like more information about this practice, or would like to know
    your choices about not having this information used by advertising companies, please visit
    http://www.networkadvertising.org. Furthermore, you can opt out of Google’s personalized advertising by visiting
    https://www.google.com/settings/ads and any other vendor’s use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting

<div><br></div>
<div>We use Google Analytics on SERANDs; information on how this collects and processes data can be found at:
    https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. In addition, we have enabled certain Google Analytics advertising
    features that utilize cookies. These features enable us to obtain certain demographic and interest data for visitors
    to SERANDs. You can opt out of these features by visiting https://www.google.com/settings/ads.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We may use Google AdWords remarketing to trigger advertisements across the Internet. AdWords remarketing will
    display relevant ads tailored to you based on what parts of SERANDs you have viewed by placing a cookie on your
    machine. This cookie does not in anyway identify you or give access to your computer. The cookie is used to say
    "This person visited this page, so show them ads relating to that page." Google AdWords remarketing allows us to
    tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you. If you do not wish to
    participate in our Google AdWords remarketing, you can opt out by visiting https://www.google.com/settings/ads.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>In addition, we may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be
    given access to personal information including your name, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing
    you information regarding certain products and services. When you make an inquiry about certain listings on SERANDs
    (e.g. used cars listings from dealers), you are expressly choosing to, and opting-in to, have us transfer your
    personally identifiable information to our third party service partners, and for such third party service partners
    to provide your personally identifiable information to other businesses who provide products or services that match
    your inquiry. The third party service partners may contact you regarding your inquiry.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor
    information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer
    such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution.
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>Notice of new services and changes</b></h3>
<div>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to SERANDs, new
    services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As our customer, you will be given the opportunity to
    notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.
</div>
<div><br></div>
<h3><b>How do we protect your information</b></h3>
<div>We may employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your
    personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. We may
    use secure socket layer and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally
    identifiable information.
</div>
<div><br></div><h3><b>Certain disclosures</b><br></h3>
<div>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action
    is necessary to (a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or affiliated parties; (b) protect
    and defend our rights and property, our site, the users of our site, and/or our affiliated parties; (c) act under
    circumstances to protect the safety of users of our site, us, or third parties.
</div>

    Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on SERANDs to keep you aware of
    what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. If you have any
    questions, feel free to contact us.
